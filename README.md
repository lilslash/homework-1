# I started by adding the header tag to line 11-28
# Next I chnaged the div tag on line 14-26 to nav for the screen reader I had to change some tags in CSS (lines 27,35,39) to get the nav tage to display properly
# I wasn't sure how often to use section tags instead of div tags so I took the long route and decided to change the majority od the div tags to sections tags. if I'm not mistaken they are almost interchangable. It didn't break the site and the screen reader worked properly so I didn't see the issue.
I added descriptions to the images that didn't have some
last I added a footer to the end lines 89-94 the copyright and website creator
For personal fun I enlarged the font size of the P tags just to try it out
